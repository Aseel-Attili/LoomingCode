"Looming Code" It is an innovative programming educational platform designed to teaching programming languages and enhance their coding skills, with focus on user experience via three main features:

Dynamic Website Management: we developed a system that allows moderators to easily add and update course content without needing to write code. This includes adding and removing quizes. Moderators can also use simple buttons to add text and code snippets, making it easy to format and design their lessons and saves time.

Helper System: Within the course page, learners can use this intelligent feature "helper system" that facilitates and saves learning time by helping them choose the appropriate chapter to start their studies after taking a short test that assesses their knowledge and level in that language. Subsequently, some calculations are performed to determine the result that reflects the best chapter for the learner to begin their study.

Recommender System: We developed a content-based recommendation system that allows users to determine the most suitable programming language based on their choices and preferences through a series of questions that the learner answers, reflecting their interest in the features of the language they wish to start with, making learning more efficient and tailored.
